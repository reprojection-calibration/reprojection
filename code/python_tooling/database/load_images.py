# NOTE(Jack): The images hold a special place in the database that sets it apart from all tables. And that is, it is the
# only table with NO foreign key relationship. That means that it defines what can and what can not exist as data in the
# rest of the database. All other tables have one way or another a foreign key relationship on the image table.
